below is the final part of my script. I would like a counter to tell me how many rows have been processed def check_address_chain(row, col_a, col_b, col_c, col_d ): if check_address(row, col_a, col_b): if check_address(row, col_c, col_d) : return 2 else: return 1 else: return 0 df['match_score'] = df.apply(check_address_chain, col_a='expanded_stater_address_no_box', col_b='expanded_bnp_address_no_box', col_c='expanded_stater_address_with_box', col_d='expanded_bnp_address_with_box', axis=1)
